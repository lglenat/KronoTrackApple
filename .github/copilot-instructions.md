This is an iOS SwiftUI project for the Krono Location app, ported from Android. Use MapKit for maps, CoreLocation for background location tracking (1-minute updates if possible), URLSession for networking, and UserNotifications for notifications. The app should:
- Fetch course list from server
- Allow bib, birth year, and code input
- Display GPX track and user location on a map
- Upload location every minute in the background
- Use iOS best practices and match Android app's features and branding as closely as possible.
